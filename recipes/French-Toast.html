  <h1>How to Make French Toast</h1>
  <p>
    t's easier than you think to make restaurant-quality French toast in the
    comfort of your own kitchen – you just need a skillet, a few staple
    ingredients, and a good recipe. That's where we come in!
  </p>
  <h1>French Toast Ingredients</h1>
  <p>
    Every home cook has their own twist on basic French toast, but most
    variations contain the following ingredients:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>White Bread:</b> Thick-cut bread is the base for all French toast.
      Sturdy, dense, slightly stale slices absorb the custard-like egg mixture
      better than thin, airy ones.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Eggs:</b> When it comes to French toast, eggs are essential. The
      proteins solidify once they're heated, which binds the batter together
      and ensures a rich texture. The fat, meanwhile, adds extra creaminess.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Milk:</b> You can technically use any liquid to make French toast,
      though milk is most popular. Not only does milk add the necessary
      moisture, but the fat gives the batter extra richness. This recipe calls
      for whole milk because it creates the ideal texture. You can easily
      substitute half-and-half, cream, or your favorite alternative milk –
      full-fat varieties will produce the creamiest consistency.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Vanilla and cinnamon:</b> The best French toast is warm, cozy,
      aromatic, and sweet. The cinnamon and vanilla in this recipe are
      optional, but we definitely recommend using them for the most delicious
      experience. You could even add a little nutmeg or sugar if you feel like
      it.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Salt</b> Don't skip the salt! Just a pinch won't affect the flavor.
      Salt helps break down the eggs, incorporate them into the batter, and
      prevents egg chunks in the finished product.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Butter</b>Like so many of the most decadent foods, the best French
      toast is made with butter. If your French toast has the tendency to
      burn, try frying the batter-soaked bread in a combination of butter and
      oil.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Is French Toast Really French?</h1>
  <p>
    Nope! French toast (pain perdu in French) isn't actually from France.
    Legend has it that a man named Joseph French from the U.S. created the
    sweet breakfast dish in 1724 and named it after himself. However, that's
    probably not true: People were frying milk- and egg-soaked bread in
    Ancient Rome, according to early recipes. It's more likely that modern
    French toast was invented by 15th-century cooks who were on a mission to
    use up stale bread.
